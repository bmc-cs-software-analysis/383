This course offers an introduction to the theoretical foundations of software analysis and its applications in software engineering and security. Effective program analysis is essential for ensuring the reliability, security, and performance of software systems. Students will explore a range of methods for analyzing program behavior including testing, static analysis, and formal methods. The course emphasizes both theoretical knowledge and practical experience through implementation of analysis tools and engaging with current state-of-the-art techniques.
